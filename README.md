# UserTrash

Playing around with Adobe XD, I created a mock up for an app that tracks and schedules trash pick up. 

Some assumptions:

- The user already has a trash can that connects to their wifi network and reads the level of trash in the can
- there is a trash service that would allow scheduled pick ups
